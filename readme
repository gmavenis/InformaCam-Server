If you're pulling this from Github, you will need a LocalConstants.java file.  This file has a pointer to the project's root directory.

It should be contained in /org/witness/informa/utils/LocalConstants.java and should look a bit like this:


package org.witness.informa.utils;

public class LocalConstants {
  public final static String WEB_ROOT = "/absolute/path/to/repo/";
	public final static String USERNAME = "couchdb username";
	public final static String PASSWORD = "couchdb password";
}
